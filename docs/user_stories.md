**Please enter the user stories for the web application here.**
*A user story is a short (1-2 sentence) informal spec  written from the point of view of a user, which outlines their role and what they would like to achieve.*
## Examples:
* "As an **X**, I would like to do **Y** without having to do **Z** so that I can accomplish business function **W**." 
* "As **a mechanic**, I would like the car scanner software to **display the error codes, a short description and an image of the engine with the problem area highlighted**. This will allow me to **localize the problem and select the right tools more quickly**."
* "As **a chef** I would like the ingredient list to be **displayed without the need for hands** so that I can **read the recipe while cooking**."

## User Stories
