# Informal Specification
**Please enter the user stories for the web application here.**
*A user story is a short (1-2 sentence) informal spec  written from the point of view of a user, which outlines their role and what they would like to achieve.*
## Examples:
* "As an **X**, I would like to do **Y** without having to do **Z** so that I can accomplish business function **W**." 
* "As **a mechanic**, I would like the car scanner software to **display the error codes, a short description and an image of the engine with the problem area highlighted**. This will allow me to **localize the problem and select the right tools more quickly**."
* "As **a chef** I would like the ingredient list to be **displayed without the need for hands** so that I can **read the recipe while cooking**."

## User Stories
* As **someone concerned about heart disease,** I would like to **enter a simple test result and receive graphical and numerical results of my heart disease risk over time.** This will allow me to **easily interpret the prediction and make better overall health choices.** 
* As **a person confirmed to be suffering from heart disease,** I would like to **have the highest risk areas highlighted for me, with links to resources to address these issues.** This will allow me to **target the most important areas first.**
* As **a generic user,** I would like to have the option **enter a minimal subset of test features.** This is because medical tests are expensive and invasive and I would like **to receive results with as little distress as possible.**
